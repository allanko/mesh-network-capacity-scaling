# Experimentally Measuring Capacity in Wireless Mesh Networks

This repository contains the final data and Python scripts (used in conjunction with the CBMEN Android networking testbed at MIT Lincoln Lab) used to support my capstone project in MIT AeroAstro. For more information about the MIT AeroAstro 16.62x capstone, see [this article](http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/news/magazine/aeroastro-no3/200616.62x.html) and the [MIT course catalog](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m16b.html#16.621). 

## Project abstract

The per-node throughput capacity scaling of stationary unicast multihop wireless mesh networks is experimentally assessed. Using an Android networking testbed, we deploy wireless networks of size n = 10, 20, 30, and 40 in an office environment. We saturate each network with all-to-all Poisson traffic and calculate the network capacity as the average data reception rate per node. By fitting a least-squares power law, we find that the network capacity scales as 1/n^0.93 (R^2 = 0.84), which is below the theoretical upper bound and better than prior experimental measurements of capacity scaling. However, this result is ultimately inconclusive due to experimental limitations, primarily the poor connectivity of the network and the linear topology imposed by the office environment. We discuss the limitations of our methodology and propose avenues for future experimentation.

## About

### Project report

The full project report, along with a slide deck from my final presentation, is available in [`docs`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/tree/master/docs).

### Data

The logfiles from the experiments used in the final report are available in [`170424\deployed`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/tree/master/170424/deployed). 

The reduced data is compiled in [`final-data.xlsx`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/blob/master/final-data.xlsx).

### Python scripts

There are three Python scripts, sorted into separate notebooks:

* [`generating experiment files.ipynb`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/blob/master/generating%20experiment%20files.ipynb) generates a new experiment specification. The experiment specification files are placed in the [`experiments`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/tree/master/experiments) folder. These files are loaded onto the Android testbed server to specify the parameters of each experiment. The script takes as inputs an experiment name, number of nodes, duration, packet size, and per-flow packet transmission rate for all-to-all Poisson traffic. 

* [`data reduction.ipynb`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/blob/master/data%20reduction.ipynb) takes as input the log files from a finished experiment. It generates and saves a plot and a XLSX file of the per-node throughput according to a sliding 60-second window. These are saved to the experiment directory.

* [`connectivity heatmaps.ipynb`](https://github.com/allanko/mesh-network-capacity-scaling/blob/master/connectivity%20heatmaps.ipynb) loads the XLSX file generated by `data reduction.ipynb` to generate connectivity matrices for the experiment, based on how many packets are received by each node from each other node in the network. These plots are saved to the experiment directory.
